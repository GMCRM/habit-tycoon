# Safari/iPad Profile Creation Fix - Testing Guide

## Problem Fixed
OAuth users (particularly on Safari/iPad) were not getting their user profiles created properly with the initial 100 habit cash when signing up.

## Changes Made

### 1. New Method: `ensureUserProfileExists()`
- Added to `auth.service.ts`
- Includes retry logic (3 attempts with 1-second delays)
- Uses `upsert` to handle both creation and updates
- Specifically designed for Safari/iPad timing issues

### 2. Updated Auth State Handler
- Modified `app.component.ts` to call profile creation immediately when user signs in
- Ensures OAuth users get their profiles created right after authentication

### 3. Updated Existing Pages
- Modified `home.page.ts` and `create-habit-business.page.ts` to use the robust method
- Simplified the profile creation logic

## Testing Instructions

### Manual Testing (Recommended)
1. **Test on Safari/iPad:**
   - Clear browser data/cache
   - Go to the app login page
   - Sign up with Google OAuth
   - Verify that after sign-in, the user has 100 habit cash
   - Try creating a habit business to confirm cash is available

2. **Test Retry Logic:**
   - Use network throttling or airplane mode briefly during sign-in
   - Verify that the retry logic works and profile eventually gets created

3. **Test Different Browsers:**
   - Test on Chrome, Firefox, and Edge to ensure no regression
   - Verify OAuth flow works correctly across browsers

### What to Look For
✅ **Success Indicators:**
- New OAuth users start with exactly 100.00 habit cash
- No "profile not found" errors in browser console
- Smooth transition from sign-in to home page
- User can create habit businesses without cash issues

❌ **Failure Indicators:**
- User has 0 cash or undefined cash after sign-in
- Console errors about profile creation
- Cannot afford to create habit businesses
- Profile creation errors in network tab

### Console Logs to Monitor
Look for these log messages:
- `🔍 Ensuring profile exists for user:` - Profile creation initiated
- `✅ Profile created/updated successfully:` - Profile creation succeeded
- `⏳ Retrying profile creation in 1000ms...` - Retry logic active
- `❌ Failed to ensure profile exists:` - Profile creation failed

## Browser Developer Tools Test

You can also test the new method directly in browser dev tools:

```javascript
// In browser console (after login)
const authService = window.ng?.probe(document.body)?.injector?.get('AuthService');
if (authService) {
  authService.ensureUserProfileExists().then(profile => {
    console.log('Test result:', profile);
    console.log('Cash amount:', profile.cash);
  }).catch(error => {
    console.error('Test failed:', error);
  });
}
```

## Expected Behavior After Fix
1. User signs in with Google OAuth on Safari/iPad
2. Auth state change triggers profile creation automatically
3. Profile is created with cash: 100.00 and net_worth: 100.00
4. User is redirected to home page with proper cash balance
5. User can immediately create habit businesses without issues
