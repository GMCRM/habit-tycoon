# Interactive Habit Business Cards - Implementation Summary

This implementation adds interactive functionality to the habit business cards on the home page of the Habit Tycoon app, meeting all three requirements:

## ‚úÖ Requirements Implemented

### 1. Manual Reordering (Drag-and-Drop)
- **Added Angular CDK**: Installed `@angular/cdk` for drag-and-drop functionality
- **Database Schema**: Added `display_order` and `user_custom_order` fields to `habit_businesses` table
- **UI Changes**: Added drag handles (‚ãÆ‚ãÆ) to each habit card with visual feedback
- **Service Methods**: 
  - `updateHabitBusinessOrder()` - Updates database when user reorders cards
  - Enhanced `getUserHabitBusinesses()` to order by `display_order` instead of `created_at`

### 2. Automatic Move to Bottom on Completion
- **Auto-Sorting**: Modified `completeHabitBusiness()` to automatically move completed habits to bottom
- **Service Method**: `moveCompletedHabitsToBottom()` - Separates completed/incomplete habits and reorders
- **Completion Detection**: Uses existing `isCompletedToday()` logic for both daily and weekly habits
- **Preserves Order**: Non-completed habits maintain their custom order, completed habits are sorted by their original custom order

### 3. Reset on New Day/Week
- **Reset Logic**: Added `resetToCustomOrder()` method that restores habits to user's preferred order
- **Integration**: Automatically called during daily habit reset in `loadDashboardData()`
- **Smart Reset**: Only affects `display_order`, preserves `user_custom_order` for future resets

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation

### Database Changes
```sql
-- Added to habit_businesses table
ALTER TABLE habit_businesses 
ADD COLUMN display_order INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
ADD COLUMN user_custom_order INTEGER DEFAULT 0;
```

### Key Files Modified
1. **`src/app/services/habit-business.service.ts`**
   - Updated `HabitBusiness` interface with new fields
   - Added ordering and reset methods
   - Modified `getUserHabitBusinesses()` and `createHabitBusiness()`

2. **`src/app/home/home.page.ts`**
   - Added Angular CDK drag-drop imports
   - Implemented `onHabitBusinessDrop()` for reordering
   - Enhanced completion logic with auto-sorting

3. **`src/app/home/home.page.html`**
   - Added `cdkDropList` and `cdkDrag` directives
   - Added drag handle icons for visual indication

4. **`src/app/home/home.page.scss`**
   - Added drag-and-drop styling with visual feedback
   - Drag preview effects and placeholder styling

### User Experience Features
- **Visual Feedback**: Cards rotate slightly when being dragged
- **Placeholder**: Dashed outline shows drop location
- **Smooth Animations**: CSS transitions for fluid reordering
- **Success Toasts**: User feedback on successful reordering
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallbacks if operations fail

## üéØ Behavior Flow

1. **Initial Load**: Habits displayed in `display_order` (or creation order for new users)
2. **User Reorders**: Drag-and-drop updates both `display_order` and `user_custom_order`
3. **Habit Completion**: Automatically moves completed habits to bottom while preserving relative order
4. **Day/Week Reset**: When habits reset, they return to `user_custom_order` positions
5. **New Habit Creation**: Assigned next available order number

## üîÑ State Management

The implementation uses two order fields to handle the dual requirements:

- **`display_order`**: Current display position (changes with completion status)
- **`user_custom_order`**: User's preferred base order (preserved for resets)

This allows the system to temporarily reorganize habits based on completion status while maintaining the user's preferred organization for the next period.

## ‚ú® Key Benefits

1. **Intuitive UX**: Familiar drag-and-drop interaction pattern
2. **Automatic Organization**: Completed habits don't clutter the active list
3. **Persistent Preferences**: User's custom order is remembered across resets
4. **Responsive Design**: Works on both desktop and mobile devices
5. **Non-Disruptive**: Changes integrate seamlessly with existing functionality

The implementation is minimal and surgical, only touching the necessary files and maintaining backward compatibility with existing data.
