# 🚀 EPIC 5: Business Upgrades & Stock Market Implementation

## 🎯 Overview

This epic introduces a revolutionary business upgrade system and social stock market that transforms habit tracking into a strategic investment game. Players can monetize their streaks by upgrading businesses and invest in friends' habit businesses for passive income.

## 🏗️ Core Features

### 1. Business Upgrade System

**Concept**: Convert streak value into cash and upgrade to higher-tier businesses

- **Streak Monetization**: Total streak value = Daily earnings × Streak count × 30 days
- **Upgrade Process**: Sell streak → Gain cash → Purchase better business → Reset streak to 1
- **Strategic Decision**: Maintain streak for growth vs. upgrade for better base pay

**Example**:

- Lemonade Stand (Base: $1) with 100-day streak = $100/day
- Streak value = $1 × 100 × 30 = $3,000
- Can upgrade to Coffee Shop ($500) for $2,500 profit + better base pay

### 2. Dynamic Stock Market

**Concept**: Each habit business has publicly traded shares that fluctuate with streak performance

- **Stock Price Formula**: Base pay × streak multiplier
- **Risk/Reward**: Stock prices rise and fall with business owner's streak consistency
- **Share Distribution**: 80% owner-retained, 20% public availability

**Stock Price Examples**:

- Lemonade Stand: $1 (Day 1) → $100 (Day 100) → $0.50 (streak broken)
- Oil Company: $9.9M (Day 1) → $3.6B (Day 365)

### 3. Mutual Benefit System

**For Business Owners**:

- **Stock Boost**: 5% earnings bonus per 10% of shares owned by others
- **Maximum Boost**: 50% bonus when 100% of public shares are owned
- **Example**: $100 base earning → $150 with full investor support

**For Stock Investors**:

- **Dividend Payments**: 50% of business owner's stock boost
- **Capital Gains**: Profit from stock price appreciation
- **Social Investment**: Support friends' habits for passive income
