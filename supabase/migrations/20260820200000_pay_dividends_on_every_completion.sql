-- Fix: for multi-completion-per-day habits (goal_value > 1), stockholders
-- only ever got paid a dividend on the tap that happened to complete the
-- day's goal — every earlier tap paid the owner their per-tap earnings
-- (base + stock boost + streak bonus, split evenly since
-- 20260810000000_split_stock_streak_bonus_per_completion.sql) but never
-- called process_habit_completion_dividends, so stockholders collected
-- nothing for it.
--
-- e.g. a habit with goal_value = 5: the owner is correctly paid 5 equal
-- installments across the day, but stockholders were only ever paid a
-- dividend on installment 5 — losing 4/5 of what they should have earned
-- that day, and losing all of it if the owner never finished the 5th tap.
--
-- complete_habit_business gated the PERFORM process_habit_completion_dividends
-- call inside `IF v_is_goal_completed THEN ... END IF`, alongside
-- update_stock_price_by_streak and notify_friends_of_milestone — but unlike
-- those two (which are genuinely once-per-day, streak-completion events),
-- dividends are earned per completion, same as the owner's own payout.
--
-- Fix: pay dividends on every completion, unconditionally. Streak-price
-- updates and milestone notifications stay gated to goal completion — that
-- part was correct. Everything else in this function is byte-for-byte
-- identical to the live version (20260810010000_fix_dividend_per_share_formula.sql).
